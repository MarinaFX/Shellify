### What is Shellify? 
Shellify is a command-line tool based application for local reproduction of songs. If your internet is down or not yet installed, but still you need to catJAM those beats, Shellify is the way to go! 

###  How Shellify works
Here in this repository lays the source code for our application, therefore we are still working on ways to make it easier to create the executable and just run. But assuming you already have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your OSx (Mac, MacBook) just simply create an Xcode project and import the source code inside it. Once imported, just execute as a normal command-line program. 

### Command list
- **play** song-name-here | plays the song you've inserted
- **skip** | skips to next song. If last, skips back to the first
- **pause** | pauses the song
- **exit** | exits the program 

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ¥³
